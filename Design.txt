A simple txt file to keep track of my progress and how I designed this application

The idea is to create a simple key-value database that listens to a port from where the client can send and retrieve data. This is done by java socket programming

The ClientHandler handles the input data from the open socket. Use buffered reader and retrieve data from inputdataStream.
Store the input as a string and extract the command and the args from it and perform the necessary actions. The output is written by the printWriter and sent to the socket via the outputDataStream.
Once the output is sent, the printwriter will flush the buffer (specified by the true argument passed to printwriter)

The first basic implementation covers the simple operations of SET, GET, DELETE and UPDATE
